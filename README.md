## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use window.addEventListener during resize to make sure that if the user leaves the mobile menu open when resizing the screen it won't break the site styling.


### Useful resources

Pixel Perfect Pro browser extension. It allows me to overlay the design images, helping to better position the page elements and saving time in the process
